    "Fresh Start Worlds was marketed as a way to bring new and returning players to Runescape and give them a boost in progression to get them engaged with the game. It has been debated in the community how successful this was. I have thought that Fresh Start Worlds would mainly appeal to current players who wanted an accelerated game mode with a competition, but would not lead to a large number of players continuing on with their account. (This is mainly because that's how I approached FSW.)\n",

    "In this notebook I'd like to adress the question \"Was Fresh Start Worlds\" successful. To be more specific, I would take FSW as a success if more than 5% of players that played during FSW continued to play in the main game. This number isn't based on anything any particular data. Since I expect that most players were running FSW as an alt that they planned to discard after the completion of the game mode, I would expect the overall number of players that continue to be low."

These players have clearly not been playing the game and shouldn't be included in the count of continuing players. Mud Fresh and Andre 2 have gained over 200m experience in their skills since the end of FSW, so they defintely do count as continuing players. fsw pot has gained 4.6m experience, but given they finished FSW with 3.2 billion experience, I think they probably used up some Treasure Hunter keys or played until their membership ran out, and then quit. The other 2 in the top 5 almost certainly shouldn't be considered continuing players, since their gained exp is very small for their overall exp. xxDravenX is an interesting case. They have gained much more experience since the end of FSW and increased their total level by a factor of ~5. They probably should count as a continuing player, even though their gained exp is less than LoveDrunk, who shouldn't be.\n",
